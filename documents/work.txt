Real time:
10 tiles per second
a tile : 8 x 8 pixel

Empirical evaluation:

Map: 1. homemade map 2. game map (big map)

experiment:
- basicmap 2pursuer (max 100 turn)
	- speedupcra
	- astar

- bigmap 3 pursuer (max 500 turn)




2 Graphs to do tests:
 - Interception rate
 - time


Experiments:
1.cover heuristic & speedup heuristic 
	Idea: percentage speedup
	round map with 2 pursuer 10 times max 1000
	vancacy map with 2 pursuer 10 times
	maze map with 2 pursuer 10 times
	




2. speedup heuristic & a star
	Idea: turns and interception rate
	round map with 2 pursuer 20 times: max 500
	maze map with 2 pursuer 50 times: max 1000
