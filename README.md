## Multi-Agent project
Multi-Agent pursuit a moving target by speed up cover-set and tie-breaking
# Introduction
This is a research that I am doing as a Master student in University of Tsukuba<br/>
In this research, I proposed a method for multi-agent pursuering a single moving target.<br/>
Especially this method could be used in real-time video game, such like Pacman or Starwars, Warcraft
