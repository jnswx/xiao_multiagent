# Multi-Agent project
Multi-Agent pursuit a moving target by speed up cover-set and tie-breaking
## Introduction
This is a research that I am doing as a Master student in University of Tsukuba<br/>
In this research, I proposed a method for multi-agent pursuering a single moving target.<br/>
Especially this method could be used in real-time video game, such like Pacman or Starwars, Warcraft 
## Real-time
According to pacman rules and player frame rate smooth analysis,<br>
0.1 s moves 1 tile, equally maximum planning time 0.1s one turn
## Grid environment
Currently, up, down, left and right, only four directions movement.

# Work to do
1. Abstraction
2. Refinement
3. cover -> whole map searching costs too much time
## Development environment
Programming Language: Python 2.7<br/>
## Project specially thanks to 
Pacman project of Berkeley AI CS188<br/>
